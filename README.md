# image-processing-assignment
## Deadline
**14:00 on Friday 14th December 2018**

---
### Material to be submitted
- A single PDF report covering Part A and Part B, no more than **4 pages long** (in 11pt font), _including a list of references at the end of the main document_. It can have **1 appendix which does not count toward the 4 page limit**, showing the images of the main report in higher resolution.

- A python implementation of a **joint bilateral filter** using OpenCV.

---
### Part A - Bilateral Filter
1. In Part A of the report, describe the bilateral filter and discuss its main properties.
2. Apply the bilateral filter on the test images test 1 and test 2 and fine tune the filter's parameters.
3. Present and disuss the filtered test images from part A2.

For filtering you can use the OpenCV function **_bilateralFilter_** or implement your own.

### Part B - Joint bilateral filter
1. In Part B of your report, describe the joint bilateral filter, discuss its main properties and some of its applications.
2. Implement the joint bilateral filter in OpenCV in python.
3. Fine tune the parameters of the joint bilateral filter on the pair of test images test 3a and test 3b. Present and discuss the results, illustrating the main properties of the joint bilateral filter.
